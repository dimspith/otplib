OTPLIB is a Nim package for generating, managing and verifying one-time passwords.
It can be used to implement 2FA or MFA in web applications and other systems that require users to log in.

Multi-factor Authentication standards are defined in:

- [RFC 4226](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226) - HOTP
- [RFC 6238](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238) - TOTP

OTPLIB was inspired by other OTP libraries like [GOTP](https://github.com/xlzd/gotp) and [PyOTP](https://github.com/pyauth/pyotp).
